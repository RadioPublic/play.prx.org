# PRX Embed Player

Embeddable audio playback!

# Install

Clone the project, install dependencies, and start with these defaults in your `.env` file:

```sh
npm install
cp env-example .env
```

## Developing

Due to the complexity of installing node-sass in alpine-linux, it may be easier
to just develop locally for the time being.  Just make sure you have a modern
node version installed (6.x.x, ideally).

```sh
# setup pow proxy (see http://pow.cx/)
echo 4300 > ~/.pow/play.prx

# dev server
npm start
open http://play.prx.dev
```

## Docker Install

Or if you really want to, you can develop via docker-compose.
This guide assumes you already have npm, docker and dinghy installed.

TODO: hot reloading not supported yet - this just builds the prod js.

``` sh
# build a docker image
docker-compose build

# install dev dependencies locally, so docker can mount those folders
npm install

# run the docker image, will detect changes to local file system
docker-compose up

# open up a browser to view
open http://play.prx.docker
```
